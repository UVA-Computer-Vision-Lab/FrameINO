# Dataset Setting
download_folder_path: FrameINO_data/   # Set the downloaded folder path, all the other csv will be read automatically
train_csv_relative_path:        dataset_csv_files/train_sample_short_dataset        # No need to change, Fixed

dataloader_num_workers: 4         # This should be per GPU   In Debug, we set to 1
# height_range: [480, 480]         # Height Range; By slightly modify the dataloader code and use this setting, we can use variable resolution training
target_height: 480
target_width: 720
sample_accelerate_factor: 2       # Imitate 12FPS we have set before.
train_frame_num_range: [49, 49]   # Number of frames for the trianing, required to be 4N+1
# min_train_frame_num: 49           # If it is less than this number, the dataloader will raise Exception and skip to the next one valid!


# Motion Setting
dot_radius: 6               # This is set with respect to 384 height pixel, will be adjust based on the height change
point_keep_ratio: 0.4       # The ratio of points left; Likelyhood by random.choices for each tracking point, so it can be quite versatile; 0.33 is also recommended
faster_motion_prob: 0.0     # Whether we support faster (~8FPS), 0.0 - 0.1 is also recomended (0.0 by default).


# Denoise + Text Setting
noised_image_dropout: 0.05      # No First Frame Setting, becomes T2V
empty_text_prompt: False        # FOR TI2V, we needs to use text prompt

# Training Setting
resume_from_checkpoint: False     # latest / False; latest will automatically fetch the newest checkpoint
max_train_steps: 1002             # Based on the needs; This is just a demo dataset, so training low is not needed
train_batch_size: 1               # batch size per GPU 
gradient_accumulation_steps: 2    # Equivalent to multi batch size; Total GPU 
checkpointing_steps: 2000         # Check point frequeuncy, don't recommend to be too frequent
checkpoints_total_limit: 8        # Transformer are too large, this size is too big (~32 GB per checkpoint)
mixed_precision: bf16             # CogvideoX official code usaully use bf16
gradient_checkpointing: True      # This will save the memory but slower; Even if I have 80GB memory, this is still needed to open; else, OOM
seed:                             # If we set seed here, the reading of the data in each resume will be the same as the first time, which cannot train full dataset in resume mode

# Validation Setting
validation_step: 2000         # Don't set too frequent, which will be very resource consuming
